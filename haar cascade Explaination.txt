haar is the name of the guy
looks at every square and when it gets the bottom, it knows its a face
haar features a)edge features b)line features c)Forur rectangle features
- they detect dark parts and light parts from face and judge parts of the face.eg usually forehead is brighter, eyes darker and cheeks are brighter
positive images - Faces
Negative Images - Non Faces
Theres two fields of ML : supervised(humans teach it) and unsupervised (computer teaches itself)
-> We wanna find the winning haar features
-> We gotta test every haar features continously untl we find that the image is actually a face
haar feature assigns parts of face numbers. it takes all pixels in black, adds it up in one number and it does the sqame with white pixels.
after this minus black number and white number and we find out the difference. Now we give a threshold  eg if its 50 or higher, it matches for a face if not, its not a face
we do it with other haar features as well
-> "CASCADE" - we chain the winner haar features and collectively call them a cascade classifier
OpenCV deos the hard work for us : provides all the pre trained classiffer  that have a chain of haar features which best match the frontal face.
